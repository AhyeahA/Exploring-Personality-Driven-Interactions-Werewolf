Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect Player 1, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, and Player 7 might be the villager, guard, witch, seer, and the other non-werewolf roles in the game.

I need to continue working with my teammate to eliminate non-werewolf players and secure our victory. However, I must be cautious not to reveal my role to avoid suspicion from the other players.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. As a werewolf, I know that Player 2 and Player 7 are my teammates.
